# PARKING LOT PROBLEM

# Rules of the Game

			0) You have two full days to implement a solution
			1) You can use any (fairly) mainstream object oriented language of
			your choice, so long as your solution builds and runs on linux. You
			should be fine if you favour, say, Java, Ruby, Python or Javascript.
			2) Please ensure that you follow the syntax and formatting of both the
			input and output samples. We validate submissions using automated
			tests.
			3) We are really, really interested in your object orientated
			development skills, so please solve the problem keeping this in mind.
			4) Unit tests are mandatory, so please ensure that all your code has
			tests/specs. Additionally, it's a huge plus if you test drive your
			code.
			5) Please ensure that the coding conventions, directory structure and
			build approach of your project follow the conventions set by popular
			open source projects in the language that you're using.
			6) When implementing this solution, please use a version control
			system of your choice that works on Linux and OSX. We expect you to
			send us a zip/tarball of your source code when you're done that
			includes the VCS metadata in the tarball so we can look at your commit
			logs and understand how your solution evolved. Please do not make
			either your solution or this problem statement publicly available by,
			for example, using github or bitbucket or by posting this problem to a
			blog or forum.

			Problem Statement

			I own a multi-storey parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any
			given point in time. Each slot is given a number starting at 1
			increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of
			one. I want to create an automated ticketing system that allows my
			customers to use my parking lot without human intervention.

			When a car enters my parking lot, I want to have a ticket issued to
			the driver. The ticket issuing process includes us documenting the
			registration number (number plate) and the colour of the car and
			allocating an available parking slot to the car before actually
			handing over a ticket to the driver (we assume that our customers are
			nice enough to always park in the slots allocated to them). The
			customer should be allocated a parking slot which is nearest to the
			entry. At the exit the customer returns the ticket which then marks
			the slot they were using as being available.

			Due to government regulation, the system should provide me with the
			ability to find out:
			a) Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour.
			b) Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.
			c) Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular colour is parked.

			We interact with the system via a simple set of commands which produce
			a specific output. Please take a look at the example below, which
			includes all the commands you need to support - they're self
			explanatory. The system should allow input in two ways. Just to
			clarify, the same codebase should support both modes of input - we
			don't want two distinct submissions.
			1) It should provide us with an interactive command prompt based shell
			where commands can be typed in
			2) It should accept a filename as a parameter at the command prompt
			and read the commands from that file

			Example: File

			To run the program:

			$ my_program file_inputs.txt > output.txt


			Input (in file):

			create_parking_lot 6

			park KA-01-HH-1234 White

			park KA-01-HH-9999 White

			park KA-01-BB-0001 Black

			park KA-01-HH-7777 Red

			park KA-01-HH-2701 Blue

			park KA-01-HH-3141 Black

			leave 4

			slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White

			slot_number_for_registration_number KA-01-HH-3141

			slot_number_for_registration_number MH-04-AY-1111


			Output (to console, newline after every output):

			Allocated slot number: 1

			Example: Interactive


			To run the program and launch the shell:

			$ my_program

			Assuming a parking lot with 6 slots, the following commands should be
			run in sequence by typing them in at a prompt and should produce
			output as described below the command:

			Input:
			create_parking_lot 6

			Output:
			Created a parking lot with 6 slots

			Input:
			park KA-01-HH-1234 White

			Output:
			Allocated slot number: 1

			Input:
			park KA-01-HH-9999 White

			Output:
			Allocated slot number: 2

			Input:
			park KA-01-BB-0001 Black

			Output:
			Allocated slot number: 3

			Input:
			park KA-01-HH-7777 Red

			Output:
			Allocated slot number: 4

			Input:
			park KA-01-HH-2701 Blue

			Output:
			Allocated slot number: 5

			Input:
			park KA-01-HH-3141 Black

			Output:
			Allocated slot number: 6

			Input:
			leave 4

			Output:
			Slot number 4 is free

			Input:
			status

			Output (we've used a table to make our lives easier, but tab delimited
			output is fine):
